# Static-site Generator
Live Link for the project->(https://manav010203.github.io/static-site/)
### ABOUT
If you have open this above link it might seem a normal website to you which is built using the html css but quiet not that is the case. In this, I have used markdown as my language and have created a generator which will convert my markdown to a html css automatically i.e i dont have to write html css myself rather the genrator will write it for me 
### Run on your own env
- just clone the github repo and run command ~ ./build.sh
### Learnings
- Learn about how the markdown is used and how it happens at the backend.
- Markdown really plays an important role in making the user experience smooth as user dont have to care about html,css at all.
- want to learn about markdown ~ (https://www.markdownguide.org/)
 
And if wondering i have use github pages for hosting my project as it supports static site hosting.
